# Overview

  As a company grows, from the backend point of view, there will be a lot of APIs, functions and services which will be needed.
  Managing all of them under one single architecture will become very cumbersome. This calls for a multiple smaller instances or services which can run in parallel. To mitigate this need, we will study about microservices

## Introduction

The architecture type is a particular way of developing software, web or mobile applications as suites of independent services â€“ a.k.a microservices. These services are created to serve only one specific business function, such as: user management, user roles, e-commerce cart, search engine, social media logins, etc. Furthermore, they are independent of each other, meaning they can be written in different programming languages and use different data storages. The centralized management is almost non-existent and the microservices use lightweight HTTP, REST or Thrift APIs for communicating between themselves.

## Assessment

1. Microservices is most closely related to what other established acronym?

	A. API

	B. AWS

	C. SOA
	
	D. PaaS

	ANSWER - C. Microservices is most closely related to service-oriented architecture (SOA) in its architectural design structure. Enterprise Architect Todd Biske said, "in the spirit of evolutionary design, microservices is part of SOA's evolution."

2. Why would a microservices architecture be beneficial?

	A. A suite of services can be deployed and upgraded without a rebuild of other, functioning services.
	B. Less service interruption for fast-paced cloud computing.
	C. Different parts of a development team can manage individual parts of a microservice.
	D. All of the above.
	E. None of the above.
	
	ANSWER - D. Microservices is a way of designing software applications as individual suites of services, completely independent of one another.

3. Why would microservices not be beneficial?

	A. If your organization is starting with microservices, rather than a monolith.
	B. Your organization is not successfully strategizing for such compartmental design.
	C. Members of a development team aren't as knowledgeable.
	D. All of the above.
	
	ANSWER - D. All the above steps are necessary for any development to be successful, particularly microservices. This architecture is designed to relieve frustrations of monoliths; however, without having the proper monolith background, failure is inevitable.

4. Hence the name, microservices is meant for smaller businesses.
	A. True
	B. False

	ANSWER - B. Despite the "micro" in its name, larger businesses have taken to this design fairly well. Amazon, Netflix and The Guardian are just a few of the famously large enterprises who are pioneering the style.
