There's a huge difference between how we receive the data and how we want to use it.

We make the data usable we have to process it through various steps. This is applicable everywhere - Server or Client.

We will explore how we can manipulate data in Node.js and JavaScript

  

## Learning Outcomes

  

- Learn data manipulation in the JavaScript

- Explore and learn about the package Lodash and Underscore.js

## Introduction

  

**Data manipulation** is the process of changing data to make it easier to read or be more organized. For example, a log of data could be organized in [alphabetical order](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/l/lexisort.htm), making individual entries easier to locate. It could be about aggregating or transforming the data.

  

## What you must do?

  

- Learn about data manipulation in JavaScript with this [comprehensive article](http://learnjsdata.com/)

- Learn about [lodash](http://zetcode.com/javascript/lodash/) and [underscore.js](https://keyholesoftware.com/2016/10/24/an-introduction-to-underscore-js/) which is used for data manipulation

- Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhQkErkEips) along  with this [code](https://github.com/shama/letswritecode/tree/master/js-arrays) to look at data manipulation in action.

## Assessment Quiz

1.  What will be the output of this code

		  var customers = ["Ram", "Ali", "Geeta", "Asha", "Jerry"]
		  customers.slice(0,3)
	A) ["Ram", "Ali", "Geeta"]
	B) ["Ram", "Geeta",  "Jerry"]
	C) ["Ram", "Ali", "Geeta", "Asha", "Jerry"]
	D) ["Ram",  "Asha"]
	Answer B

2. Let's consider we had 8 pending orders in restaurant defined in this array
		
	    pending_orders = ["pizza", "burger", "ice cream", "Mango shake", "potato fries", 
	    "hot coffee", "burger", "pizza"]

	Now, all the pizzas and burgers are prepared, how can you use lodash to remove them from pending orders array

	Answer

		const _ = require("lodash")
		_.pull(pending_orders, ""pizza,"burger");

3. Split this array into positive and negative numbers

		nums = [4, -5, 3, 2, -1, 7, -6, 8, 9];
	Answer
		
			const _ = require("lodash")
			let [nums2, nums3] = _.partition(nums, (e) => e < 0);

4. What is the difference between .findWhere() and .where() in underscore.js

	Answer

	Both the functions takes an array name and the property to match but the _.where() function displays all the matches whereas, _.findWhere) function matches only the first match.

5. Which of the following method canâ€™t be used to add array elements in JavaScript.  
	A) push( )  
	B) shift( )  
	C) splice( )  
	D) All are can be used
	Answer B
