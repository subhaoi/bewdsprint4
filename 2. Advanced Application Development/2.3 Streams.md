We work with system that consume real time data, our backend framework need capability to consume this real time data without multiple requests.

Also websites have evolved, the data being sent and received has increased manifold, even though the internet speeds have increased, it is important to have a system where we don't need to wait for the entire website to render till the whole data has been received on the browsers

  

## Learning Outcomes

  

- Learn about streams and how they change the behaviour of websites

- Learn how to leverage Node.js to implement streams

  

## Introduction

  

Streaming involves breaking a resource that you want to receive over a network down into small chunks, then processing it bit by bit. This is something browsers do anyway when receiving assets to be shown on web pages â€” videos buffer and more is gradually available to play, and sometimes you'll see images display gradually as more is loaded.

  

With Streams you can start processing raw data bit by bit as soon as it is available on the client-side, without needing to generate a buffer, string, or blob.

  

## What you must do?

  

- Understand what are streams and the different types from this [article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_streams.htm)

- Read this [article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_streams.htm) to further your knowledge about streams in Node.js

 - Watch these videos to study about [readable streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3tTzx0Qoj0) and [writable streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvlCT0N7yQI).

## Assessment Quiz

1. What are the different types of streams?

  Streams are of 4 types 
  - Readable that promotes reading operation
  - Writable that promotes writing operations
  - Duplex that promotes above both
  - Transform is a kind of duplex stream which does the computation based on available input.

2.  What is the chaining mechanism?

  Chaining is a mechanism to connect the output of one stream to another stream and create a chain of multiple stream operations.

3. What is the piping mechanism?

  Piping is a mechanism where we provide the output of one stream as the input to another stream. It is normally used to get data from one stream and to pass the output of that stream to another stream.
