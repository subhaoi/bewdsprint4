Node.js is an advanced and modern backend framework, it comes with a lot of features which enables us to build really powerful and efficient applications.

Socket is one of such feature which optimises the communication between the server and client (Browser, Mobile Apps or Desktop app)

  

## Learning Outcomes

  

- Learn about sockets, how they are useful for communication

- Learn how to implement them in Javascript and Node.js

  

## Introduction

  

Sockets enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.

A server runs on a specific computer and has a socket that is bound to a specific port number. The server just waits, listening to the socket for a client to make a connection request.

  

The client knows the hostname of the machine on which the server is running and the port number on which the server is listening. To make a connection request, the client tries to rendezvous with the server on the server's machine and port. The client also needs to identify itself to the server so it binds to a local port number that it will use during this connection. This is usually assigned by the system.

  

If everything goes well, the server accepts the connection. Upon acceptance, the server gets a new socket bound to the same local port and also has its remote endpoint set to the address and port of the client. It needs a new socket so that it can continue to listen to the original socket for connection requests while tending to the needs of the connected client.

  

On the client side, if the connection is accepted, a socket is successfully created and the client can use the socket to communicate with the server.

  

The client and server can now communicate by writing to or reading from their sockets.

## Assessment

  

1. Is closing a socket mandatory, after performing operations?

  

A. Yes

B. May be

C. Can be

D. No

  

Answer - A

  

  

2. Which of the following are type of valid environments for socket programming?

  

A. Iterative

B. Multi-threaded

C. Proxy

D. Virtual

  

Answer - A

  
  

3. When does the TCP socket connection goes into the TIME_WAIT state?

A. When client does not close the connection

B. Packets arriving in correct working order

C. Connection request goes into a queue

D. When client closes the connection

  

Answer - D

  

TCP socket connection goes into the TIME_WAIT state whenever a connection is closed and there is no connection open. In either of the case, if any connection is open, TCP socket connection does not go into TIME_WAIT state.

  

4. Is socket programming a point to point connection?

  

A. May be

B. No

C. Yes

D. Can be

  

Answer - C

Socket programming is built to establish a connection between specified host(s). It is neither a multi-cast or a broadcast, rather It is point to point connection between these hosts.

5. Which of the following are types of participant?

  

A. Open

B. Blocked

C. Inactive

D. Passive

Answer D

Participants may be active or passive, there are no other types of participants which have been listed.

  

  

6. Which of the following ports is available for socket programming?

A. 8080

B. 21

C. 25

D. 8081

  

Answer D

21 is occupied for ftp, 25 is for smtp, 8080 is usually occupied for http. 8081 may be occupied if it is set by servlet container, but in default circumstances it is available.
