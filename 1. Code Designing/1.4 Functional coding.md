We explored object oriented programming in JavaScript and Node.js. There is another programming paradigm which is really useful - Functional Programming.

  

  

## Learning Outcomes

  

  

- Learn about functional programming in Javascript

  

- Explore the use of function programming in Node.js

  

  

## Introduction

  

  

**Functional programming** (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing **pure functions**, avoiding **shared state,**  **mutable data,** and **side-effects**. Functional programming is **declarative** rather than **imperative**, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

## Assessment Quiz

  

1. Which is the following is true about Pure functions?

    A) Depend on some external inputs in addition to provided inputs to produce the output.

    B) Don't rely on data outside the current function, and also do not change data that exists outside the current function.

    C) Take input and return no output

    D) Take no input but return some output

    Answer B

  

2. Which of following is true about Higher order functions?

    A) The input and output can be a function

    B) It is compulsory have a input value, output is optional

    C) These function are only used built complex functionalities

    D) None of These

    Answer A

  

3. Functions can also be assigned to object properties rather than variables

    A) True

    B) False

    Answer A

  

4. Which of the following is not an advantage of Pure Functions?

    A) They're easier to reason about and debug because they don't depend on mutable state.

    B) The return value can be cached or "memoized" to avoid recomputing it in the future.

    C) They're easier to test because there are no dependencies (such as logging, Ajax, database, etc.) that need to be mocked.

    D) We can assign functions to a variables

    Answer D


5. What's the difference between 1st class functions and higher order functions?

    When you say that a programming language has first-class functions, it means that the language treats functions as values â€“ that you can assign a function into a variable, pass it around etc. Higher-order functions are functions that work on other functions, meaning that they take one or more functions as an argument and can also return a function.
