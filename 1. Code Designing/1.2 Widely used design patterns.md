We have now understood, why should we learn design patterns, we will now look at the prominent design patterns and understand how they can be used for the right use case.

  

  

## Learning Outcomes

  

  

- Learn the commonly used design patterns in Node.js

  

- Look at implementation of different design patterns and understand their use for different use cases

  

  

## Introduction

  

  

In programming, there are some instances where we have to use only one instance of the object, then we will use the Singleton pattern. But there can be instances, we want to access inner elements sequentially multiple times, then we will use the iterator pattern.

  

These patterns help in controlling the hardware usage to according to use cases. Now, we will look at many such patterns

## What you must do?

  

  

- Study the [commonly used design patterns in javascript](https://medium.com/better-programming/commonly-used-design-patterns-in-javascript-bfcd91827002)

  

  

- Get your hands dirty with this [comprehensive guide to javascript design patterns](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/comprehensive-guide-javascript-design-patterns)

  

  

  

## Additional Resources

  

  

- You can explore this book [Design Patterns : Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.uml.org.cn/c++/pdf/DesignPatterns.pdf), though this book is an old textbook which is based on C++. This can be a good read for studying the theory behind design patterns.

## Assessment Quiz

  

  

1. Which of the following pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically?

  

  

A. Iterator Pattern

B - Mediator Pattern

C - Memento Pattern

D - Observer Pattern

  

Answer - A

  

  

2. Which of the following pattern is used when we want to pass data with multiple attributes in one shot from client to server?

  

A - Factory Pattern

B - Abstract Factory Pattern

C - Singleton Pattern

D - Transfer Object Pattern

  
  

Answer : D

  

Explanation

Transfer Object Pattern is used when we want to pass data with multiple attributes in one shot from client to server.

  

3. Which of the following describes the Singleton pattern correctly?

  

A - This pattern creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface

B - In this pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes.

C - This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.

D - This pattern is used when we want to pass data with multiple attributes in one shot from client to server.

  

  

Answer : C

  

Explanation

  

Singleton involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.

  

  

4. Name the different types of Design Patterns?

  

  

Design patterns can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns.

  

Creational Patterns - These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

  

Structural Patterns - These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

  

Behavioral Patterns - These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

  

5. In factory method pattern, the framework must instantiate classes but it only knows about the abstract classes, which it cannot initiate. How would one solve this problem?

A) encapsulating the knowledge of which document subclass to is to be created and

B) moving this knowledge out of the framework

C) instantiating the application specific documents without knowing their class

D) all of the mentioned

  

Answer: D
