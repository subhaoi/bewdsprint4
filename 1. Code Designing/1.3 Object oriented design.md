We looked at different design patterns that are available in JavaScript and in turn be used in Node.js.

  

Now, we will explore Object Oriented Programming in Node.js. Object Oriented Programming is a technique which enables the programmer to design complex structures and their associated functions just once and keep using them multiple instances.

  
  

## Learning Outcomes

  

- Revise your concepts of the object oriented programming in JS

  

- Learn the application of object oriented programming in Node.js

  

  

## Introduction

  

  

It all starts with an object.

An object is a thing that we interact with, it has properties and methods. The object is the heart of object-oriented programming, not only for JavaScript but also for Java, C, C++, and others. Stop thinking about individual variables and functions and start thinking in terms of self-sufficient objects contain the data/properties and also the methods associated.
